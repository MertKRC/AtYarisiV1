# Horse-Race
Basic horse race application. 
It's my first C# Windows Form Application project and it's just for educational purposes. 

Logic behind it;

There are 3 horses Gulbatur,Åžahbatur and Hidalgo and when you press the start button they'll start running with random speed.

The win chance of all horses are same. For example; if you select Gulbatur, you will win %33.33^ of all races. 

There will be updates soon and change logs will be accessible below this text.

I'm open for any advices or ideas.
